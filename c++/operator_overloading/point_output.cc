 * @brief Overloading operator<<
 *        Overloading operator<< is similar to overloading operator+
 *        (they are both binary operators), except that the parameter types are different.
 *        Consider the expression
 *
 *            std::cout << point
 *
 *        If the operator is <<, what are the operands?
 *        The left operand is the std::cout object, and the right operand is your Point class object.
 *        std::cout is actually an object of type std::ostream
 *
 *        We return the left hand parameter as a reference.
 *        This not only prevents a copy of std::ostream from being made, it also allows us to “chain”
 *        output commands together, such as std::cout << point << std::endl;
 *
 *        You might have initially thought that since operator<< doesn’t return a value to the caller,
 *        we should define the function as returning void.
 *        But consider what would happen if our operator<< returned void.
 *        When the compiler evaluates std::cout << point << std::endl;, due to the precedence/associativity
 *        rules, it evaluates this expression as (std::cout << point) << std::endl;.
 *        std::cout << point would call our void-returning overloaded operator<< function, which returns void.
 *        Then the partially evaluated expression becomes: void << std::endl;, which makes no sense!
 *
 *        By returning the out parameter as the return type instead, (std::cout << point) returns std::cout.
 *        Then our partially evaluated expression becomes: std::cout << std::endl;, which then
 *        gets evaluated itself!
 *
 *        Any time we want our overloaded binary operators to be chainable in such a manner, the left operand
 *        should be returned (by reference).
 *        Returning the left-hand parameter by reference is okay in this case --since the left-hand parameter
 *        was passed in by the calling function, it must still exist when the called function returns.
 *        Therefore, we don’t have to worry about referencing something that will go out of scope and
 *        get destroyed when the operator returns.
